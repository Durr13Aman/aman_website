              <h3>Pre-College</h3>
              <p>
                Aman's journey in engineering began with a desire to create solutions that mattered.
                When he noticed a trash problem in his neighborhood, he built a{' '}
                <strong>simple robot with a vision of cleaner pathways</strong>. It was far from perfect,
                but it was his first real project, and it left him hooked.
              </p>
              <p>
                His passion for problem-solving grew from there. In 2019, after the <strong>Nirbhaya case</strong>,
                Aman felt compelled to address the issue of safety. He considered self-defense devices
                like tasers, but realized they were often inconvenient to carry and could easily run
                out of charge. That insight inspired him to design a{' '}
                <strong>shoe with a built-in taser</strong>, powered by the energy generated with every step.
                This ensured the device was always charged and ready in an emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was through this project that Aman realized he wanted to be an{' '}
                <strong>engineer with purpose</strong>, using innovation to create meaningful change in the world.

              <h3>College Years</h3>
              <p>
                At the <strong>University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison</strong>, Aman found a new passion: cars.
                What began as solving everyday problems grew into a fascination with performance and sustainability.
              </p>
              <p>
                He co-created a <strong>solar-powered car</strong> with a small team of peers, taking on a
                complex challenge that required collaboration and technical skill. The car competed at the{' '}
                <strong>Formula Sun Grand Prix</strong>, where the team won the{' '}
                <strong>Rookie of the Year Award</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                He also contributed to building an <strong>electric race car</strong>, working on electronics,
                battery systems, and lightweight design to advance clean transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alongside these projects, Aman spent much of his time on software. He began with embedded coding
                and gradually became deeply invested in artificial intelligence. What started as curiosity grew
                into a drive to use AI to solve real-world problems.

              <h3>Today</h3>
              <p>
                Today, Aman is focused on transforming industries by helping business owners integrate
                AI into their workflows. Through his work at <strong>Synatech</strong>, he is building tools
                and strategies that make artificial intelligence accessible, practical, and impactful
                for organizations of all sizes.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, he is passionate about reshaping the consulting industry. Traditional
                consulting often struggles with inefficiencies. Consultants spend long hours preparing
                proposals that rarely convert, and there is frequently a disconnect between what clients
                envision and what consultants deliver.
              </p>
              <p>
                This challenge inspired <strong>Lemur AI</strong>, a platform Aman is building alongside
                his work at Synatech to help consultants understand their clients' vision more clearly,
                allowing them to write winning proposals in minutes instead of days.
